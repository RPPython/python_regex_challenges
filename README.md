## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. **Open your terminal** (CMD or Git Bash on Windows).
2. **Navigate** to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. **Clone the repository** using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/geek-courses/python_regex_challenges.git
   ```

4. **Navigate** into the project directory:
   ```
   cd python_regex_challenges
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Separate Branch
1. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
   Replace `your-branch-name` with &lt;your name&gt;_solution, like `iva_solution`.

2. **Verify** that you are in your new branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```
   The terminal should display a list of branches, with an asterisk (*) next to your new branch name.

### Step 3: Implement Your Solution
1. **Open the project** in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm).
3. **Implement your solution** in the `regex_solutions/regex_functions.py` file, following strictly the tasks description given in [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

### Step 4: Run Tests
1. **Run the tests** to ensure your solution is correct:
   ```
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
   All tests should pass if your solution is correct.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
1. **Stage your changes**:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
2. **Commit your changes** with a meaningful message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Implement solutions for regex challenges"
   ```

### Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub
1. **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. **Navigate** to the repository on GitHub.
2. **Click** on the "Compare & pull request" button next to your branch.
3. **Fill out** the PR form with a title and description of your solution.
4. **Click** on the "Create pull request" button.


Happy coding!
